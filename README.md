The Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle is a classic binary classification problem. The goal is to use passenger data from the Titanicâ€™s ill-fated maiden voyage to predict whether a given passenger survived or not.

Task: Predict the target variable Survived (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived).

Training Data: Contains information about ~890 passengers, including whether they survived.

Test Data: Contains information about ~418 passengers, but without the survival outcome (you must predict this).

ðŸ”¹ Features in the dataset include:

Pclass â€“ Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Sex â€“ Gender of the passenger

Age â€“ Age in years (some missing values)

SibSp â€“ Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch â€“ Number of parents/children aboard

Fare â€“ Ticket fare paid

Embarked â€“ Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

Other identifying columns (like Name, Ticket, Cabin) can sometimes be engineered into useful features.
